* ``npm init``
* ``tsc --init``

* ``express``
* ``body-parser``
* ``nodemon -dev``

    * ``graphql`` (_Mori: maybe it's better not to use TS on GraphQl to learn the GraphQL schema better._)
    * ``express-graphql``

* For TS:
    * ``@types/node -dev``
    * ``@types/express -dev``
    * ``@types/body-parser -dev``

After installing these packages in one tab of terminal first run ``tsc -w`` and in other tab, after that run ``npm start``.
